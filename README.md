## 📋 Overview
A dynamic web application designed to track and manage birthdays. This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to **Full Stack Development**, covering backend logic with Python/Flask, frontend templating with Jinja2, and responsive UI design with Bootstrap.

## 🚀 Features
- **Dynamic Data Entry**: Users can add new birthdays through a clean, validated web form.
- **Real-time Display**: Automatically updates the birthday list without manual page refreshes (via POST/Redirect/GET pattern).
- **Responsive Design**: Fully accessible on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices thanks to Bootstrap integration.
- **Clean Architecture**: Follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for better code organization.

## 🛠️ Technical Skills Demonstrated
- **Backend Development**: Routing, request handling, and session management in Flask.
- **Frontend Development**: HTML5, CSS3, and Jinja2 templating.
- **State Management**: Handling form submissions and data persistence (mocked for this demo).
- **UX/UI Design**: Implementing a user-friendly interface with modern CSS frameworks.
